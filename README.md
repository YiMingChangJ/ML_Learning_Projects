# ML_Learning_Projects

## About

This repository contains a collection of machine learning projects completed during my 4th year of undergraduate studies as part of a course on machine learning. These assignments and problem sets showcase my skills in implementing various ML algorithms and techniques using Python libraries like TensorFlow, PyTorch, Keras, and XGBoost. The projects cover regression, classification, gradient boosting, deep neural networks (DNNs), convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and transfer learning, applied to both theoretical models (e.g., Ising model) and real-world datasets (e.g., MNIST, bird species classification).
